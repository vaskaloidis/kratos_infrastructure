### Spoof extension method to use?
#
# RUBY - RTLO Right to Left Override
# This trick uses Right to Left unicode to reverse the last six characters so that
# the extension is spoofed, for example a notes.exe file can be renamed to notesexe.txt
# Although the file extension clearly shows as .txt in Explorer the Windows operating
# system still recognizes the file as an application. example of 1ยบ method: notesexe.txt
#
# BASH - Hide Extensions for Known File Types
# There is a setting in Folder Options where you can hide the file extension so that
# only the filename is visible in Explorer while the extension is hidden. The problem
# with this setting is the default option is set to hide and a less careful user can be
# tricked when there is a double extension. An example of 2ยบ method: notes.txt.exe
#
# backdoorppt by default uses 'Right to Left Override' (ruby)
# but it can be config to use 'Hide Extensions for Known File Types' (bash)
# Accepted values are: YES (bash) or NO (ruby)
----------------------
BASH_TRANSFORMATION=NO
----------------------




### BYPASS RESOURCEHACKER SOFTWARE WORK
# This option bypasses the use of resourcehacker.exe to chance the icons
# of the payload to be transformed (you will have to change the icons manualy)
# because backdooppt will only chance the payload extensions if this option is active.
# Accepted values are: YES or NO
------------------------
RESOURCEHACKER_BYPASS=NO
