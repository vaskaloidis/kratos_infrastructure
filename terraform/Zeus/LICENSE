Feel free to take the code, use it how you wish, just keep in mind that if it's my code, 
attribute me BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY if I used someone else's code or ideas, 
make sure to credit them and respect their licenses. 

Our goal for this code is to help the security community and vulnerability research in general,
